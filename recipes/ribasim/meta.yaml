  description: |
    The Ribasim Python package (named `ribasim`) aims to make it easy to build, update and
    analyze Ribasim models programmatically.

    The Ribasim QGIS plugin allows users to construct a model from scratch without programming.
    For specific tasks, like adding observed rainfall timeseries, it can be faster to use
    Python instead.

    One can also use Ribasim Python to build entire models from base data, such that your model
    setup is fully reproducible.

    The package is [registered in PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ribasim/) and can therefore
    be installed with `pip install ribasim`.
    For documentation please see the [examples](https://deltares.github.io/Ribasim/python/examples.html) and [API reference](https://deltares.github.io/Ribasim/python/reference/).
