  patches:
    # Looks like they forgot to add update outputs in nasm and xz
    - system_nasm.patch
    - system_xz.patch
    # Can't use keyword arguments in ctx.template()
    - repo_template.patch
    # we are using openssl instead of boringssl (Google's fork)
    # it mostly works out of the box, but we need to make sure the right symbol is used
    # we are commenting out an include that doesn't exist on openssl
    # and also replacing an old function name with its modern equivalent-ish (_cleanup->_reset)
    - oauth-boringssl.patch
    # These two patches are FUN: we patch the workspace script from bazel
    # so it patches the half.hpp header it will download with our meta-patch :D
    # Idea for patch coming from # https://sourceforge.net/p/half/discussion/general/thread/86298c105c/
    - net_sourceforge_half.patch
    - half.hpp.patch.patch
