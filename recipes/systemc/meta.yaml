  summary: 'The language for System-level design, modeling and verification'
  description: |
    SystemC(TM) addresses the need for a system design and verification language that spans hardware
    and software. It is a language built in standard C++ by extending the language with the use of
    class libraries. The language is particularly suited to model system's partitioning, to evaluate
    and verify the assignment of blocks to either hardware or software implementations, and to
    architect and measure the interactions between and among functional blocks. Leading companies in
    the intellectual property (IP), electronic design automation (EDA), semiconductor, electronic
    systems, and embedded software industries currently use SystemC for architectural exploration,
    to deliver high-performance hardware blocks at various levels of abstraction and to develop
    virtual platforms for hardware/software co-design. SystemC has been standardized by the Open
    SystemC Initiative (OSCI) and Accellera Systems Initiative and ratified as IEEE Std. 1666(TM)-2011.
