    - {{ compiler('c') }}                    # [not win] NB on windows this would activate Visual Studio and make that the default C/C++ compiler

    - {{ stdlib("c") }}                      # [not win] on Windows this pulls in VS and causes cmake to use its cl.exe, which is incompatible with the m2w64 version of windres.exe

  summary: 'Python package for calculating air-water exchange of heat and momentum'
  description: |
    The Air-Water EXchange Python package contains algorithms for calculating
    air-water fluxes of sensible/latent heat and momentum from meteorological
    conditions and the surface state of the ocean/lake. Its core is written in
    Fortran for maximum performance. This makes it suitable for calculating
    air-water exchange during simulations with Python-based hydrodynamic models.
