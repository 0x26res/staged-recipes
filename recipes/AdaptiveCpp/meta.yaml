  summary: 'The independent, community-driven platform for heterogeneous programming in C++'
  description: |
    AdaptiveCpp is the independent, community-driven modern platform for
    C++-based heterogeneous programming models targeting CPUs and GPUs from all
    major vendors. AdaptiveCpp lets applications adapt themselves to all the
    hardware found in the system. This includes use cases where a single binary
    needs to be able to target all supported hardware, or utilize hardware from
    different vendors simultaneously.
