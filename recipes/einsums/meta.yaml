## NOTES
# * BLAS/LAPACK
#   * Einsums actually requires the whole quartet: blas, cblas, lapack, lapacke.
#     But since both MKL and OpenBLAS distribute all four together, only blas is listed.
#   * Einsums _does_ compile different code for MKL vs. other distributions, hence the
#     `blas_impl` in cbc.yaml. MKL and OpenBLAS are known to work. netlib would
#     probably work. Accelerate definitely _doesn't_ work. And blis hasn't been tested.
#     Building only MKL and OpenBLAS variants seemed to cover most uses most safely.
# * hptt
#   * hptt cmake is setting some native tuning flags that might need to be defeted.
