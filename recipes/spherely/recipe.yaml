  summary: 'Manipulation and analysis of geometric objects on the sphere'
  description: |
    Spherely is the counterpart of Shapely (2.0+) for manipulation and analysis
    of spherical geometric objects. It is using the widely deployed open-source
    geometry library s2geometry via the library s2geography which provides a
    GEOS compatibility layer on top of s2geometry.
