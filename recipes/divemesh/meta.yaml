  summary: "REEF3D : Open-Source Hydrodynamics"
  description: |
    REEF3D is an open-source hydrodynamics framework.  The software is efficiently parallelized, 
    designed to run on a large number of processors. High-order spatial and temporal discretization 
    schemes result in accurate and stable numerical behavior. The modular programming approach 
    allows the framework to incorporate a range of different flow solvers which together represent
    all relevant length scales. With a focus on coastal, marine and hydraulic engineering flows, 
    tailor-made multiphysics solvers are available for a range of relevant problems 
    (e.g. sediment transport or floating body dynamics).
