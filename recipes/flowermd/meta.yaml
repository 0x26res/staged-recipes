  summary: "Flexible library of organic workflows and extensible recipes for molecular dynamics."
  description: |
	flowerMD is a modular “wrapper” package for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation pipeline development, designed to enable fast, reproducible, end-to- end simulation workflows with minimal user effort.
	This package is a wrapper for MoSDeF packages and Hoomd-Blue with a focus on simulating soft matter systems.
	An object-oriented design makes flowerMD extensible and highly flexible.
	This is bolstered by a library-based approach to system initialization, making flowerMD agnostic to system identity, forcefield, and thermodynamic ensemble, and allowing for growth on an as-needed basis.
