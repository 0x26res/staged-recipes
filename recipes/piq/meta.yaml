  summary: PyTorch Image Quality (PIQ)
  description: |
    PyTorch Image Quality (PIQ) is a collection of measures and metrics for
    image quality assessment. PIQ helps you to concentrate on your experiments
    without the boilerplate code. The library contains a set of measures and
    metrics that is continually getting extended. For measures/metrics that can
    be used as loss functions, corresponding PyTorch modules are implemented.
