  summary: Meta-package containing all NVIDIA NVSHMEM  packages, not intended for use in a conda-build context.
  description: |
    NVIDIA NVSHMEM is an NVIDIA based "shared memory" library that provides an easy-to-use CPU-side interface to allocate pinned memory that is symmetrically distributed across a cluster of NVIDIA GPUs.
    NVSHMEM can significantly reduce communication and coordination overheads by allowing programmers to perform these operations from within CUDA kernels and on CUDA streams.
