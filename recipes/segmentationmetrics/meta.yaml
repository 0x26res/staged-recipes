  summary: Binary segmentation accuracy metrics
  description: |
    A small package for assessing the accuracy of binary segmentations. 
    There are lots of metrics that can be used to compare how close 
    two segmentations are, here voxel overlap, surface and volume 
    based metrics are all calculated at once and returned either as 
    individual metrics, a dictionary or a Pandas DataFrame.
