  summary: 'Simple percent Encoding/Decoding'
  description: |
    This modules provides simple URI (Percent) encoding/decoding. The main purpose of this module (at least for me) was to provide an easy method to encode strings (mainly URLs) into a format which can be pasted into a plain text emails, and that those links are 'click-able' by the person reading that email. This can be accomplished by NOT encoding the reserved characters.
