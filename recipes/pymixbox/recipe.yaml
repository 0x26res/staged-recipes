  summary: 'Pigment-Based Color Mixing'
  description: |
    Mixbox is a new blending method for natural color mixing. It produces saturated gradients with hue shifts and natural secondary colors during blending.
    Yellow and blue make green. The interface is simple - RGB in, RGB out.
    Internally, Mixbox treats colors as real-life pigments using the Kubelka & Munk theory to predict realistic color behavior.
    That way, colors act like actual paints and bring more vibrance and intuition into digital painting.
