  summary: 'compute Air Mass Factors (AMF) for trace gas retrievals derived from satellite sensors'
  description: |
    BeAMF serves as a tool designed to compute Air Mass Factors (AMF) for trace gas retrievals
    derived from satellite sensors. It relies on lookup tables (LUT) of altitude-dependent AMF,
    generated through radiative transfer code.
