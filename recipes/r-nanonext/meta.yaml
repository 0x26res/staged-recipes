  summary: R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ. NNG is a socket library
    providing high-performance scalability protocols, a cross-platform standard for
    messaging and communications. Serves as a concurrency framework for building distributed
    applications, utilising 'aio' objects which resolve automatically upon completion
    of asynchronous operations. Implements synchronisation primitives, allowing R to
    wait upon events being signalled by concurrent messaging threads.
