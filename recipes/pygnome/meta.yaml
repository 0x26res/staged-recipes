    PyGNOME is a python package that encapsulates the functionality of GNOME.
    GNOME (General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment) is a modeling tool
    developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
    Office of Response and Restoration (ORR), Emergency Response Division.
    It is designed to support oil and other hazardous material spills in the
    coastal environment, and is also a full featured, flexible particle
    tracking system, that can be used for other oceanographic transport
    applications, such as fish larvae, marine debris, etc.
