about:
  summary: physical quantities (numbers with units)
  description: |
    QuantiPhy is a Python library that offers support for physical quantities.
    A quantity is the pairing of a number and a unit of measure that indicates
    the amount of some measurable thing. QuantiPhy provides quantity objects
    that keep the units with the number, making it easy to share them as single
    object. They subclass float and so can be used anywhere a real number is
    appropriate.
