  summary: 'CONQUEST: Large-scale DFT calculations'
  description: |
    CONQUEST is a DFT code designed for large-scale calculations, with 
    excellent parallelisation. It gives a consistent, exact diagonalisation 
    approach for systems from 1 to 10,000+ atoms, and brings the possibility
    of linear scaling calculations on over 1,000,000 atoms. The code has 
    been demonstrated on scaling to nearly 200,000 cores and 2,000,000 atoms.
