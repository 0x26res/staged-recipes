# test:
#   # Some packages might need a `test/commands` key to check CLI.
#   # List all the packages/modules that `run_test.py` imports.
#   imports:
#     - simplejson
#     - simplejson.tests
#   # For python packages, it is useful to run pip check. However, sometimes the
#   # metadata used by pip is out of date. Thus this section is optional if it is
