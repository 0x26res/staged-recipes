  summary: Lightweight parallel code execution and distributed computing. Designed for simplicity,
    a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously, on local or network resources,
    resolving automatically upon completion. Features efficient task scheduling, scalability
    beyond R connection limits, and transports faster than TCP/IP for inter-process
    communications, courtesy of 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen).
